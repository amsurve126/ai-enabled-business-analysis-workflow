RISKS & GAPS
------------
- Missing Information:
  - Specific regulatory standards and compliance requirements applicable to the app.
  - Detailed list of self-service features beyond viewing policies and downloading documents.
  - Target platforms (iOS, Android, both) and supported device versions.
  - Authentication and authorization methods for secure access.
  - Data privacy and retention policies.
  - Performance and availability expectations.
  - Integration points with existing backend systems.
  - User roles and permissions (e.g., primary policyholder vs. additional insured).
  - Metrics or KPIs to measure reduction in customer service calls.

- Ambiguities:
  - Definition of "secure"—encryption standards, session management, etc.
  - Scope of policy details to be viewed (summary vs. full details).
  - Whether offline access to documents is required.
  - Notification mechanisms are undecided—types (push, email, SMS), triggers, frequency.

- Potential Risks or Open Questions:
  - Risk of non-compliance if regulatory requirements are not fully captured.
  - Potential complexity in integrating with legacy systems.
  - User adoption risk if self-service features are insufficient or not user-friendly.
  - Data security risks if authentication and data protection are not clearly defined.
  - Impact on customer service if notifications are delayed or not implemented effectively.
  - Open question on how to handle policy updates or changes within the app.
